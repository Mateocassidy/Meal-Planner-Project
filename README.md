## Description

I wanted to create a FREE website to display a calorie calculator based on fitness goals with an inventory of meal options that allow you to hit those calories! I learned you may need to turn off AdBlocker for the API to show up, how to overwrite bulma/bootstrap framework, and how to implement bulma columns and sizes. We also dealt a lot with git issues and fixing merge conflicts as a group.
