## Description

I wanted to create a FREE website to display a calorie calculator based on fitness goals with an inventory of meal options that allow you to hit those calories! The website allows a user to create a meal plan to achieve their calorie intake goals. I learned you may need to turn off AdBlocker for the API to show up, how to overwrite bulma/bootstrap framework, how to implement bulma columns and sizes, resolving GIT merge conflicts with branches, implementing 2 different APIs, utilizing modals, and how to collaberate with a team on a project!
