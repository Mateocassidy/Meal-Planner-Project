## Description

I wanted a website to display a bmi calculator with meal options that allow you to hit those calories/macros for FREE! I learned you may need to turn off AdBlocker for the API to show up, how to overwrite bulma/bootstrap framework, how to implement bulma columns and sizes, this section will be about what we learned as we code through the project.. !
